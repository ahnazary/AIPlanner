# AI PLanner

AIPlanner is a Python based tool for summarizing long descriptions of events into a downloadable `.ics` file which can be then added to any calendar application (e.g. Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.). 

-------------------

The tool uses a chat interface to interact with the user and extract the event's details. At its core, the tool uses 2 main components:

1. [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) for natural language understanding. Generates responses and interacts with the user to extract info of the event to be added to the calendar.
2. [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) for the web interface. The user interacts with the tool through a web interface.


## Usage and Interfacing

1. The user interacts with the tool through a web interface. The tool asks the user for the event's details and the user responds with the details by inserting them in the chat and pressing `Send Message` button.

</p>

2. After sending the details, the tool will process the user's input and extract the event's details. Then it will ask the user if the details are correct. The user can either confirm the details by pressing the `Add Event` button, or correct the details by **reproviding all the details** and **furthur details** in the chat and sending them by pressing the `Send Message` button. Below is an example of the tool's response after processing the user's input:

</p>

3. If the user confirms the details, the tool will finalize the event and add it to the calendar `.ics` file. The user can download the `.ics` file by pressing the `Download .ics File` button. Below is an example of the `.ics` file that is generated by the tool:

```ics

4. The `.ics` file can be added to any calendar application (e.g. Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.) by importing it. Below is an example of how the `.ics` file looks like when added to Calendar:
